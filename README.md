# Internal-Assessment-Budgetting-System

This goodwill prototype system includes fundamental aspects of managing finance and assets related to the employees. Inherently, it focuses on User Interface in relation to functional transactions using databases such as PostgreSQL. However, due to lack of time, necessary security concepts were not included such as the implementation of encryption, further authorization models (2FA), and more, as such the project is deemed unsafe for employees to use. It was a fun project to work on though, as it mainly focused on practicing SQL and OOP concepts alongside python's own libraries. Reason as to why python was chosen instead of C or C# was due to the better UI toolkits python offered (in my opinion) and also cause of the tight deadline in implementing the system (considering it was a one person project). 

No further changes will be made with this program. The system has been phased out and has been passed to the organization for their own management and use. It contains an admin panel, database system, login system, and more. For more information on how to use this program or if pushes to the repository will be made, contact my discord 43c7 to discuss it's use. Thank you.
